# client-ui — DeliveryHub customer shop

The shop of one business at `<slug>.<domain>`: the same page is the **website** and the **Telegram Mini App**.
It talks only to the [Shop API](../docs/api.md#shop-api) on its own host (`/api/v1/...`) — the host selects the
business. React 19 · Vite 8 · TypeScript 6 (strict) · React Router 7 · TanStack Query 5 · Tailwind CSS 4.

**Features**

- Menu: business header (logo, name; the links and the language on the right), search above the brand hero
  (tagline, chips, popular photos; Uzbek/Russian names, apostrophe-tolerant), categories with scroll-spy — a
  list on the left from 1360px, sticky chips below that — popular dishes (a grid of cards on wide screens, a
  swipeable row on phones), menu lines (name, description, price, photo) whose round "+" turns into a stepper in
  place (next to the price where there is room, on the corner of the photo on phones), product details sheet.
  The cart beside the menu starts level with the hero; every page keeps the same width. `brand_color` becomes the accent (`--brand*` CSS variables,
  readable text colour is computed; a navy or near-black brand turns into light buttons on the dark theme) and is
  cached so the next visit paints in the right colour.
- Cart: persisted per shop host, synced between tabs, minimum-order progress, "clear" with undo; always-open side
  panel on desktop (lines with unit price, delivery time, total), bottom sheet + floating bar on phones.
- Checkout: delivery/pickup, address + "use my location" (Telegram `LocationManager` inside Telegram, browser
  geolocation elsewhere), name, phone (`+998` mask, "share my Telegram number" in the Mini App), cash/card, comment.
  Client-side validation, server `validation` errors mapped to fields, `min_order`, `product_not_found` (removed
  from the cart), `401` (sign-in again). Contact details are remembered for the next order.
- Sign-in: automatic in Telegram (`initData`); on the website phone + SMS code (resend timer, attempts left,
  `debug_code` shown in development) or "Telegram orqali kirish" (deep link + polling every 2 s). A new account is
  asked for its name. Token in localStorage per host; any `401` signs out.
- Orders: active orders and history, order page with a live tracker (delivery: accepted → on the way → delivered;
  pickup: accepted → handed over; rejected banner with a call button), polling while active, reorder.
- Profile: name, language (uz/ru, saved on the account), theme (auto/light/dark on the website), support phone.
- Telegram Mini App: `ready`/`expand`, Telegram theme → CSS variables, MainButton for the primary action (cart,
  checkout, add to cart, reorder), BackButton for sheets and screens, haptics, safe areas, header/background colours.
  On the website the browser back button closes sheets and leaves screens (sheets are history entries).
- Skeletons, empty and error states (offline, suspended business, unknown shop, 404), toasts, smooth sheet/page
  transitions with drag-to-dismiss, `prefers-reduced-motion`, keyboard and screen-reader support.

## Scripts

| Command | |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | dev server on <http://food.localhost:5173>, `/api` and `/media` proxied to `http://localhost:8100` (`BACKEND_URL` to change) with the original `Host` header |
| `npm run dev:mock` | the same UI without a backend: the Shop API is served by the test MSW handlers with a demo menu (`MOCK_MEDIA_DIR=/path/to/images` serves `/media/demo/*`) |
| `npm run build` | type-check (`tsc -b`) and build to `dist/` |
| `npm run preview` | serve `dist/` on :4173 (same proxy) |
| `npm test` | Vitest + Testing Library + MSW (`npm run test:watch` while developing) |
| `npm run lint` / `npm run typecheck` | oxlint / `tsc -b` |

Open the shop through a business host: `http://<slug>.localhost:5173` (e.g. `food.localhost`). Any
`*.localhost` host works with the dev server. The Telegram Mini App needs HTTPS — point a tunnel at the dev server
and set that URL as the bot's Mini App / menu button.

## Deployment

`dist/` is static: `index.html` for every unknown path (SPA routes `/checkout`, `/orders/131`, …), `/assets/*`
cached forever (file names are hashed), a missing asset is a 404. `Dockerfile` builds the app and serves it with
Caddy on :80 (`Caddyfile`). In the platform it runs as the `client-ui` service of `../docker-compose.yml`, behind the
`web` container, which sends every business host that is not an admin or platform host here. No `X-Frame-Options`:
Telegram Web opens the Mini App in an iframe.

## Structure

```
index.html            pre-paint theme/lang/brand; loads telegram-web-app.js only inside Telegram
src/
  main.tsx            waits for the Telegram SDK (if any), initialises it, renders <App>
  app/                App (router), Providers (query → toasts → i18n → theme → auth → catalog → cart), AppShell (routes, sheets)
  api/                fetch wrapper (ApiError, 401 listeners), Shop API endpoints, types from docs/api.md
  i18n/               messages.ts (every string, uz + ru), provider and helpers (t, money, dates, names)
  state/              auth, catalog (GET /shop + offline copy), cart, theme, toasts, orders, navigation (sheets in history)
  lib/                telegram (SDK, MainButton registry, haptics), geo, color (brand palette), format, storage, motion
  components/         Sheet, Button, Stepper, Segmented, PhoneInput, Field, OrderStatus/Tracker, Header, CartBar, …
  screens/            menu, checkout, orders (list + order), profile, sheets (product, cart, auth), status screens
  test/               MSW handlers (the Shop API in memory), fixtures, demo menu, Telegram mock, render helpers
```

Tests live next to the code (`*.test.ts(x)`): catalog, cart math, checkout (validation, server errors, success),
phone and Telegram sign-in, order tracker and orders, languages, the Telegram Mini App flow, helpers.
